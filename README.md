# Fluent Hash

This library is a wrapper on top of the <a href = "https://github.com/briansmith/ring"><em>ring</em></a> cryptography 
library which provides a fluent interface for generating SHA-1 and SHA-2 hashes. It provides convenience methods for
generating hashes from various data types such as the following:
- &[u8]
- Vec\<u8\>
- &str
- std::fs::File

It also supports formatting the hash values as bytes or hex.
